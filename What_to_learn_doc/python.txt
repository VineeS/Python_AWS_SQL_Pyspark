15. get the database handler as an input pull data from database : 
2 mocking inputs one is the databse handler when you are writing test case you wont be directly connecting to the database but mocking this scenario
and 2nd one is the response from the databse also needs to mocked . How will you use the mocking libraries (look for some use case and understand the scenario)
