Here are some interview questions covering `pytest`, `unittest`, and `mockito` in Python:

### `pytest` Interview Questions

1. **What is `pytest` and why is it popular for testing in Python?**

   - `pytest` is a testing framework that allows you to write simple as well as scalable test cases. It is popular because of its easy-to-write syntax, powerful features, and ability to handle both small and complex test cases.

2. **How do you run tests using `pytest`?**

   - You can run tests by executing the `pytest` command in the terminal. For example:
     ```sh
     pytest
     ```

3. **How can you specify a custom test discovery pattern in `pytest`?**

   - You can use the `-k` option to specify a custom pattern. For example:
     ```sh
     pytest -k "test_pattern"
     ```

4. **Explain the use of fixtures in `pytest`.**

   - Fixtures in `pytest` are used to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute. They are functions decorated with `@pytest.fixture` and can be used to set up state or provide data to your tests.

5. **How can you parametrize tests in `pytest`?**
   - You can use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to run a test with multiple sets of parameters. For example:
     ```python
     @pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])
     def test_increment(input, expected):
         assert input + 1 == expected
     ```

### `unittest` Interview Questions

1. **What is `unittest` in Python?**

   - `unittest` is a built-in Python module that provides classes and methods to create and run unit tests. It is modeled after Java's `JUnit` and provides a standardized way to write test cases.

2. **How do you create a test case in `unittest`?**

   - You create a test case by subclassing `unittest.TestCase` and defining methods that start with the word `test`. For example:

     ```python
     import unittest

     class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
         def test_addition(self):
             self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
     ```

3. **How do you run tests in `unittest`?**

   - You can run tests by calling `unittest.main()` in your script, or by using the command:
     ```sh
     python -m unittest discover
     ```

4. **What are some common assertions in `unittest`?**

   - Some common assertions include:
     - `self.assertEqual(a, b)`
     - `self.assertTrue(x)`
     - `self.assertFalse(x)`
     - `self.assertRaises(exc, fun, *args, **kwds)`

5. **How do you set up and tear down resources in `unittest`?**

   - You use the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to set up and clean up resources before and after each test. For example:

     ```python
     def setUp(self):
         self.resource = Resource()

     def tearDown(self):
         self.resource.cleanup()
     ```

### `mockito` Interview Questions

1. **What is `mockito` and why is it used?**

   - `mockito` is a library for mocking in Python. It is used to create mock objects for testing, allowing you to isolate the system under test and focus on the behavior of a specific unit.

2. **How do you create a mock object using `mockito`?**

   - You create a mock object by calling `mock()` with the class or instance you want to mock. For example:

     ```python
     from mockito import mock

     mock_obj = mock(SomeClass)
     ```

3. **How do you stub a method using `mockito`?**

   - You stub a method using `when` and `thenReturn` or `thenRaise`. For example:

     ```python
     from mockito import when

     when(mock_obj).some_method().thenReturn('value')
     ```

4. **How do you verify that a method was called in `mockito`?**

   - You verify method calls using `verify`. For example:

     ```python
     from mockito import verify

     verify(mock_obj).some_method()
     ```

5. **How do you reset or unstub a mock in `mockito`?**

   - You use the `unstub` function to reset all stubs. For example:

     ```python
     from mockito import unstub

     unstub()
     ```

### Combination Interview Questions

1. **How would you use `pytest` and `mockito` together in a test case?**

   - You can use `pytest` as the test runner and `mockito` for mocking dependencies. For example:

     ```python
     import pytest
     from mockito import mock, when, unstub
     from my_module import MyClass

     @pytest.fixture
     def my_class():
         return MyClass()

     def test_my_class_method(my_class):
         mock_dependency = mock()
         when(mock_dependency).some_method().thenReturn('mocked value')
         result = my_class.method_under_test(mock_dependency)
         assert result == 'expected value'
         unstub()
     ```

2. **Describe a scenario where you would choose `unittest` over `pytest`.**

   - You might choose `unittest` over `pytest` if you are working in an environment that already uses `unittest` extensively, or if you need to use its built-in features such as test discovery and verbosity options without additional configuration.

3. **Explain how to mock a database handler in a unit test using `mockito`.**

   - You can mock a database handler to simulate database interactions without a real database. For example:

     ```python
     from mockito import mock, when

     db_handler = mock()
     when(db_handler).execute_query(...).thenReturn(mock_result)
     ```

These questions should give you a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, usage, and differences between `pytest`, `unittest`, and `mockito`, and help you prepare for an interview focusing on testing in Python.
